Full and Half days.  We are open throughout the year, including school holidays. During the government school holidays we do not do structured lessons but run a special fun holiday programme. We do, however, close for one week (our mid-year break) at the end of June, then we close for three weeks at the end of each year for our annual leave.We have a separate, fully equipped, carpeted baby nursery. We cater for only 11 babies from ages birth to + 20 months (depending on development and maturity). We have 3 very experienced ladies working in the Nursery.

Mamqwathi, our surrogate mom, who has been with us for 17 years now……..mornings only.

Phelisa, our other Caregiver, works every afternoon in the Nursery and our Assistant Caregiver, Florence, works for the full day, every day
All these ladies are very special people. They are extremely patient, loving and caring, who give individualattention to the babies making them feel happy and loved.
